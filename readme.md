# YaChat Server

### Run Instructions:

While inside the YaChatServer directory, run

pip install -r requirements.txt

Then run

python main.py --port <desired port>

Note: I used the same environment as I used in my client, so it is a bit bloated. If it should fail for any reason,
      try running anyway. If you have any questions, please reach out at jcomish@utexas.edu
